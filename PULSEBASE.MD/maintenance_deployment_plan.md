# PulseBase - Maintenance and Deployment Plan

## Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure Components
- Kubernetes cluster for orchestration
- PostgreSQL with high-availability configuration
- Redis cluster for caching
- Object storage for file management
- CDN for static asset delivery
- CI/CD pipeline with staging environments

### Deployment Models
- Self-hosted: Customer-managed Kubernetes deployment
- Cloud: Managed service on AWS, GCP, Azure
- Development: Local Docker Compose setup

## Release Management

### Release Cadence
- Major releases: Quarterly
- Minor releases: Monthly
- Patch releases: As needed for critical fixes
- Release candidates: 2-week testing period before major releases

### Versioning Strategy
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- LTS (Long Term Support) versions maintained for 1 year
- Deprecation notices 3 months before feature removal
- API versioning with backward compatibility guarantee

### Release Process
- Feature branch development
- Pull request with automated tests
- Code review requirements (2 approvals)
- Merge to development branch
- CI/CD to staging environment
- QA testing and validation
- Release candidate creation
- Production deployment

## Monitoring and Alerting

### System Metrics
- Database performance (query times, connection count)
- API response times and error rates
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Vector search performance metrics
- System resource utilization
- Request queuing and processing time

### Alerting Rules
- Service availability below 99.9%
- API response time p95 > 500ms
- Database query time p95 > 200ms
- Error rate above 1%
- Cache hit ratio below 70%
- Disk space utilization above 80%

## Logging Strategy
- Structured JSON logging
- Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Correlation IDs across services
- PII redaction in logs
- Log retention policy (30 days full, 1 year aggregated)

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Schedule
- Full database backups: Daily
- Incremental backups: Hourly
- Vector indexes: Daily
- Configuration backups: On change
- Retention policy: 30 days of daily backups, 1 year of weekly backups

### Recovery Procedures
- Database point-in-time recovery capability
- Service-specific restoration procedures
- Disaster recovery runbooks
- Regular recovery testing schedule
- Recovery time objective (RTO): 1 hour
- Recovery point objective (RPO): 15 minutes

## Maintenance Operations

### Routine Maintenance
- Database vacuuming and optimization: Weekly
- Index rebuilding: As needed based on monitoring
- Cache warming after deployments
- Security patches: Within 7 days of release
- Dependency updates: Monthly review

### Scheduled Downtime
- Aim for zero-downtime deployments
- Required downtime announced 7 days in advance
- Maintenance windows during low-usage periods
- Geographic rolling updates when possible

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels
- P1: Complete service outage - 15-minute response time
- P2: Major functionality impaired - 1-hour response time
- P3: Minor functionality issues - 4-hour response time
- P4: Cosmetic issues - Next business day

### Incident Process
- Detection via monitoring or user report
- Initial triage and severity assignment
- Response team assembly based on severity
- Communication to affected users
- Mitigation and resolution
- Post-incident review
- Remediation plan implementation

## Performance Optimization

### Regular Optimizations
- Query performance analysis: Weekly
- Cache efficiency review: Bi-weekly
- Resource allocation adjustments: Monthly
- Load testing before major releases
- Database index optimization: Monthly

## Capacity Planning
- Growth forecasting: Quarterly
- Resource trend analysis: Monthly
- Scaling recommendations based on usage patterns
- Infrastructure cost optimization review: Monthly

## Security Maintenance

### Security Processes
- Vulnerability scanning: Weekly
- Dependency security audit: Bi-weekly
- Penetration testing: Quarterly
- Security patch management: Within 48 hours of critical releases
- Access review and audit: Monthly

## Compliance Maintenance
- Audit log review: Weekly
- Compliance documentation updates: Quarterly
- Privacy impact assessments for new features
- Data retention policy enforcement

## Documentation Maintenance

### Documentation Updates
- API documentation: Updated with each release
- Knowledge base articles: Monthly review
- Example code and tutorials: Quarterly refresh
- Architecture diagrams: Updated with major changes
- Runbooks: Tested and updated quarterly

## Community Support

### Open Source Maintenance
- Community PR review process: Weekly cadence
- Bug triage: Daily
- Feature request evaluation: Bi-weekly
- Community office hours: Bi-weekly
- Major contributor recognition program

### Support Channels
