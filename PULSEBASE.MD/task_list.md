# PulseBase Project - Task List

This task list helps track the progress of the PulseBase project based on the generated documentation.

## Phase 1: Project Definition & Planning (Documentation)
- [X] Create MVP Specification (`mvp.md`)
- [X] Create Product Requirements Document (`prd.md`)
- [X] Create User Stories (`user_stories.md`)
- [X] Review and Finalize MVP, PRD, and User Stories (* Documents reviewed for coherence and structure. Stakeholder feedback and formal sign-off are external steps. *)
- [ ] Break down User Stories into Epics and detailed tasks for development backlog (* Requires a planning session for prioritization, estimation, and assignment. This is an external human-dependent task. *)

## Phase 2: Technical Design & Architecture (Documentation)
- [X] Create Frontend Technical Specifications (`tech_specs_frontend.md`)
- [X] Create Backend Technical Specifications (`tech_specs_backend.md`)
- [X] Create API Documentation Structure (`api_documentation.md`)
- [X] Review and Finalize Technical Specifications (*Technical specifications (frontend, backend, API) reviewed for internal coherence and structure. Full finalization requires an architectural review session and consensus, which is an external step.*)
- [ ] Design detailed data models based on tech specs and PRD (*Awaiting finalization of PRD features and backend design input*)
- [ ] Design detailed component architecture for Frontend & Backend (*Awaiting further breakdown of tech specs*)

## Phase 3: UI/UX Design
- [X] Create UI/UX Flow Documentation (`ui_ux_flow.md`)
- [ ] Develop Wireframes for key user flows identified in `ui_ux_flow.md` (*Awaiting UI/UX design input based on `ui_ux_flow.md` and `user_stories.md`*)
- [ ] Create High-Fidelity Mockups for the platform (*Awaiting completion of wireframes and definition of a style guide/design system*)
- [ ] Conduct Usability Testing on Prototypes (*Awaiting creation of interactive prototypes and recruitment of test users*)

## Phase 4: Development Setup & Initial Implementation
- [X] Set up Version Control Repository (e.g., Git) (* GitHub repository https://github.com/Bollo444/pulsebase identified and initialized. *)
- [X] Push initial project documentation (PULSEBASE.MD contents) to the repository (* Project documentation files from the `PULSEBASE.MD` directory have been pushed to the main branch of the GitHub repository. *)
- [ ] Set up Development, Staging, and Production Environments (*Awaiting infrastructure decisions, resource allocation, and setup based on `maintenance_deployment_plan.md`*)
- [ ] Implement Core Authentication Service (Backend) (*Awaiting final backend tech specs, data model, and API design for auth endpoints*)
- [ ] Implement Basic Database Service & Schema (Backend) (*Awaiting final backend tech specs and detailed data model design*)
- [ ] Develop Initial Frontend Shell & Navigation Structure (*Awaiting final frontend tech specs and approved wireframes/mockups*)

## Phase 5: Feature Development (Iterative Sprints)
*This phase will involve multiple sprints based on the prioritized backlog from Phase 1.*
- [ ] **Sprint Planning:** Prioritize features for the first development sprint (*Awaiting finalized user stories and capacity planning*)
- [ ] **Sprint 1 - Task Example:** Implement User Registration & Login UI/Backend (*Dependent on completion of core auth service and frontend shell*)
- [ ] **Sprint 1 - Task Example:** Implement Organization Creation & Basic Management UI/Backend (*Dependent on core auth and initial backend/frontend setup*)
- [ ] ... (Further sprints for Project Management, Database Editor, AI/Vector Search, Analytics, Caching, RAG, etc.) (*Dependent on backlog prioritization, completion of previous sprints, and unblocking of dependencies*)

## Phase 6: API Implementation & Testing
- [ ] Implement all API endpoints as defined in `api_documentation.md` (*Awaiting backend development completion for each corresponding service and feature*)
- [ ] Write Unit Tests for all API endpoints (*To be done concurrently with API endpoint implementation*)
- [ ] Conduct Integration Testing for API services (*Awaiting completion and unit testing of multiple interacting services*)
- [ ] Generate and Publish full OpenAPI/Swagger specification from code (*Awaiting stabilization of all API endpoints*)

## Phase 7: Maintenance & Deployment Planning & Execution
- [X] Create Maintenance and Deployment Plan (`maintenance_deployment_plan.md`)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD Pipeline as outlined in `maintenance_deployment_plan.md` (*Awaiting selection of CI/CD tools and environment setup*)
- [ ] Configure Monitoring and Alerting Systems as per plan (*Awaiting infrastructure setup and tool selection, e.g., Prometheus, Grafana*)
- [ ] Implement Backup and Recovery Procedures detailed in the plan (*Awaiting database setup and storage solutions*)
- [ ] Perform Initial Deployment to Staging Environment (*Awaiting a stable build, CI/CD pipeline completion, and staging environment readiness*)
- [ ] Perform Initial Deployment to Production Environment (*Awaiting successful staging deployment, thorough QA sign-off, and scheduled deployment window*)

## Phase 8: Ongoing Tasks (Post-Initial Launch)
- [ ] Regular Code Reviews (*To be established as a continuous process throughout development*)
- [ ] Regular Security Audits & Patching (*To be scheduled as per `maintenance_deployment_plan.md` once the system is live*)
- [ ] Continuous Documentation Updates (User Guides, Developer Docs) (*To be done as features are developed and evolve*)
- [ ] Gather User Feedback and Plan Iterations (*Awaiting product launch and establishment of feedback channels*)
