# PulseBase - User Stories

## Database Functionality (Basic)
- As a developer, I want to create a new PostgreSQL database for my project so that I can store and manage relational data.
- As a developer, I want to define tables and schemas easily so that I can structure my application data effectively.
- As a developer, I want to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on my data via an API so that my application can interact with the database.
- As a developer, I want to set up row-level security policies so that I can control data access at a granular level.
- As a developer, I want to receive real-time updates when data changes so that I can build reactive applications.

## Database Functionality (Vector)
- As a developer, I want to store vector embeddings alongside my relational data so that I can perform similarity searches.
- As a developer, I want to generate vector embeddings for text data automatically so that I don't have to manage a separate embedding pipeline.
- As a developer, I want to perform similarity searches on my vector data via an API so that I can build AI-powered features like semantic search or recommendations.
- As a developer, I want to be able to create indexes on vector columns so that similarity searches are fast and efficient.

## Caching Layer
- As a developer, I want an intelligent caching layer for my database queries so that frequently accessed data is served quickly, reducing latency and database load.
- As a developer, I want to be able to configure cache invalidation rules so that my application always serves fresh data when needed.
- As a developer, I want to see cache performance statistics (hit rate, miss rate) so that I can understand and optimize caching behavior.

## Analytics & Data Visualization
- As a developer, I want to create custom dashboards with various chart types (line, bar, pie, etc.) so that I can visualize my application data and gain insights.
- As a developer, I want to write SQL queries to define the data for my visualizations so that I have full control over the analytics.
- As a developer, I want to track key metrics like API usage and query performance so that I can monitor the health and efficiency of my backend.
- As a business user, I want to export reports from dashboards in common formats (CSV, PDF) so that I can share insights with stakeholders.
- As a developer, I want dashboards to refresh data automatically so that I always see up-to-date information.

## AI & RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- As a developer, I want to implement RAG by combining vector search results with a large language model (LLM) so that I can build conversational AI that answers questions based on my project's data.
- As a developer, I want to configure the RAG pipeline, including the LLM, context window size, and system prompts, so that I can tailor the AI's behavior to my application's needs.
- As a developer, I want an API endpoint to send queries to the RAG system and receive generated answers along with the source documents used.

## Organization & Team Management
- As an organization admin, I want to create an organization and invite team members so that we can collaborate on projects.
- As an organization admin, I want to define roles (e.g., admin, developer, viewer) and assign them to team members so that I can control access to projects and features.
- As a team member, I want to see all projects I have access to within my organization so that I can easily switch between them.
- As an organization admin, I want to manage user access and permissions through a graphical interface so that I don't have to write complex security rules manually.
- As an organization admin, I want to view audit logs for user activity so that I can track changes and maintain security.

## Developer Experience
- As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation with examples so that I can quickly learn how to use PulseBase features.
- As a new user, I want clear getting started tutorials and guides so that I can set up my first project and API calls quickly.
- As a developer familiar with Supabase, I want a similar dashboard interface so that I can leverage my existing knowledge and be productive immediately.
- As a developer, I want CLI tools for local development and project management so that I can integrate PulseBase into my existing workflows.
